## 2023-06-26 - Day 1 - Backend Authentication

The full group was able to work on the project and finish the backend authentication. We had some issues with hashed_password and password, but was able to fix that by formatting the values to match. The data from AccountQueries needed to contain the hashed_password and not password. We used the function find_one and returned the correct values.
